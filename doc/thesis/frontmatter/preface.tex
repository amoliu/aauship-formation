\chapter{Preface}
This is a master thesis concerning the platform named AAUSHIP. This platform is an ongoing project which have Jesper Abildgaard Larsen in charge. The first steps of the AAUSHIP project started in year 2011, where in the early stages had no intend to be a USV. The project have developed into the AAUSHIP platform, which is a USV in working progress. In this thesis have Jeppe Dam and Nick Østergaard been focusing on upgrading the hardware of the platform to overcome implementation errors, designing a applicable model of the platform and designing formation control strategies for a future fleet of AAUSHIPS for surveying purposes. The idea of surveying have been in focus for some time in the project, from where an initial correspondence between AAU and Aalborg Havn has been created. Aalborg Havn has the interest in the AAUSHIP project since they have an aim to become an intelligent harbour, and the work of this project is a stepping stone for them. On the basis of this have the surveying purpose in the Limfjord become the area of interest, which have given rise of directing the AAUSHIP to this purpose.

The work in the project have both given the project group an insight of the hardware issues at the AAUSHIP, but have also given rise to investigate the formation control aspects when dealing with groups of USV. Since the early work on the AAUSHIP project only have been on a single ship, the need for internal communication have not been crucial. Now, to upgrade the platform, the ROS system have been implemented both for future work but also for testing purposes behind the desk. This have given the group the opportunity to simulate the behaviour of the AAUSHIP in a controlled designed environment, and afterwards implement and realize the design on the AAUSHIP.

\begin{description}
\item[Karl Damkjær Hansen] has been glad to answer ROS related questions, which have proven very useful when redesigning the AAUSHIP to be handled through ROS. For future implementation to the AAUSHIP fleet will his knowledge with ROS also be of importance.\\
\item[Aalborg Havn] has been willing to share data, information and experience with surveying applications, and have shown interest in the project. As the state of the project is not fully worked out, and the AAUSHIP in a platform in progress, the direct corporation with them has not reached the implementation phase with their system yet. Though have their experience with surveying proven helpful.

\section*{Reading Guide}
The following report is divided into parts, related to different phases of the project. The parts are divided into chapters, the chapters describe different aspects of the project. The chapters are subdivided a number of times to further split up the content into specific topics. The report is ended with an appendix part, that contains all the material that is relevant to the project, but not necessarily interesting to the reader, such as measurement journals and transcripts of meetings.

\item[Acronyms] are written to their full extend, the first time they are used, with the acronym in parentheses, thereafter only the acronym is used. The list of acronyms can be found \vpageref{ch:acronyms}.
\item[Notation] of vectors are written in bold font with lower case letters ($\vec{v}$), matrices are written in bold font with upper case letters ($\vec{M}$). Single variables and constants are typeset in normal math ($x$).
\item[Attached] to the report is a CD, which contains copies of web references and other digital files (source code, scripts and raw measurement data) that could be of interest to the reader. In some places in the report there will be a reference to the CD; this will look like this: \cd{/path-to-file}.
