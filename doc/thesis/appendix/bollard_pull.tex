\chapter{Bollard Pull}
\label{app:bollpull}

\section{Purpose}
The purpose of this measurement journal is to test if the force, which is applied at the vessel, is linear with the control input to the thrusters.

\section{Theory}
If the linear stepped input to the thrusters ends out in a almost linear output of the vessel it can be approximated that the translation from input to output is almost linear. This makes some of the controlling of the vessel less complicated due to the non existing non linear mapping from input to output.
