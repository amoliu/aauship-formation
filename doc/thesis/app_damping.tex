\chapter{Determination of damping coefficients}
\label{app:damping}

\section{Theory}
The theory behind this measurement journal is as descriped in section \ref{sec:hydrocoeff}. The purpose is to determine the hydrodynamic damping coefficients. This is done from three tests, first a surge test, next a sway test and lastly a rotation test.

\section{Tools}
Tools needed are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The AAUSHIP
	\item Computer
\end{itemize}
To be able to make the tests the AAUSHIP needs to have both forward thrusters and sideways thrusters. These are implemented and can be controlled from a computer.
