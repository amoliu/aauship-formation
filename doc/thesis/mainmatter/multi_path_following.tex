\section{Strategy 3: Multi Path following}
Individual paths for the vessels where they follow their respective trajectories with respect to the time. This needs to make a formation for the vessels. They might only need to know from each other how far they are on their respective trajectories, such that every agent has a time depending factor on the trajectory. If every agent fulfils its time dependency, this ensures, also by design of the trajectory, that no collision will occur. The trajectories for the individual agents can be designed from the trajectory of the leader with an offset both in distance in a direction and a time. The time dependencies can make the following agents lack in time thus make this formation as a echelon formation, and the distance with a direction spans the formation itself.
