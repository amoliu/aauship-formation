\chapter{Path Generation}
\head{A guidance system usually consists of a subsystem to generate
	paths for the trajectory it is desired to have the object follow.
	There exists multiple methodologies for this, also depending on the
mission purpose. A description of these methods are described in this
chapter with focus on pre mission defined paths.}

For these kind of guidance systems, it is usually generated via some
form of human interface -- some more intelligent than others. For the
purpose of this thesis, the interest lies in the use for surveying
purposes, such that a path should be generated from some waypoints
that is generated from some polygonal area of interest.

The concept of this is to make run lines (lawn mover pattern) with
straight line segments, and the corners can be handled in a specific
way such that the physical constraints of the ship manoeuvring ability
is considered to generate feasible paths.

\section{Improvement of Dubins Path with Clothoids}
The goal with using Clothoids (Euler Spirals) is the have a yank
continuous parametrized path.
