% This is a summary of how they use Potential Fields in "UAV Formation Flight using 3D Potential Field"
\section{One Approach for Potential Fields}
In the following approach a potential field is generated for each
agent depending on obstacles, formation, desired and actual position.
It will be a combination of virtual leader and potential field. The
principle generates a potential field to keep the formation and that
field is moved around as a virtual leader. When the virtual leader is
moved around it results in a deflection of the desired position and
causes the affected agents to get back into position. The positions of
the agents in the field is given individually to the specific agents
relative to the virtual leader. The approach generates a single
resulting vector for each agent which is used to guide the agent. The
potential field for each agent is generated from four components:
\begin{align}
\tilde{F}_i^{tot} = F_{vl}+F_{ij}^{tot}+F_{ca}^{tot}+F_{oa}^{tot}
\end{align}
where:
\begin{ffk}
\firmlist%
\item[$F_{vl}$] virtual leader force
\item[$F_{ij}^{tot}$] inter-agent forces
\item[$F_{ca}^{tot}$] agent-agent collision avoidance forces
\item[$F_{oa}^{tot}$] agent-obstacle collision avoidance forces
\end{ffk}

\subsubsection{Virtual Leader, $F_{vl}$}
The virtual leader is an anchor of each formation and controls the movement of this. This movement can either be given as a full trajectory of as a set of way points. The local virtual leader's part to the potential field is:
\begin{align}
F_{vl} &= K_{vl}(p_{vl}^n-p_i^n-[p_{vl}^n-p_{i0}^n])\\
&= K_{vl}(d_i-d_{i0})
\end{align}
$K_{vl}$ is a tuning parameter. $p_{vl}$ is position of the virtual leader, $p_i$ is position of agent $i$, $p_{i0}$ is desired position of agent $i$ and the $d$ is a shorter notation for the distances in between. The virtual leader component guides the agents directly to their desired positions relative to the virtual leader.

\subsubsection{Inter Vehicle Influence, $F_{ij}$}
This is the contribution of other vehicles to the potential field, which is expressed as:
\begin{align}
F_{ij} &= K_{ij}(p_{j}^n-p_i^n-[p_{j0}^n-p_{i0}^n])\\
&= K_{ij}(d_{ij}-d_{ij0})
\end{align}
Similar to the previously the $p$s are positions, $K_{ij}$ is a tuning parameter and $d$ is a shorter notation for the distances in between. This component preserves the formation by affecting the agents to keep their respective desired distances among themselves. Therefore is ratio between $K_{vl}$ and $K_{ij}$ a weighting that causes the agents to follow the virtual leader or to preserve their desired formation. In a swarm of $N$ agents the total component for agent $i$ given by:
\begin{align}
F_{ij}^{tot} = \sum\limits_{j=1}^NF_{ij}(i,j) \text{ for } j\neq i
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Collision Avoidance, $F_{ca}$}
The collision avoidance takes effect when the agents get closer than a pre defined distance of each other. It generates an additional field component for the vehicle $i$ which points away from the entering agent causing the agents to move away from each other. To ensure the avoidance the component converges towards infinity in the centre of the $i$'th agent. The $F_{ca}$ is expressed as:
\[
    F_{ca}^{ij}= 
\begin{cases}
    \frac{K_{ca}r}{||d_{ij}||}-K_{ca},& \text{for } ||d_{ij}||<r\\
    0,              & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]
where $K_{ca}$ is a tuning parameter. $r$ is the safety radius for collision and $d_{ij}$ is the distance between the individual agents.
The collision avoidance can be expressed in a total term of the collision avoidance:
\begin{align}
F_{ca}^{tot} = \sum\limits_{j=1}^NF_{ca}^{ij} \text{ for } i\neq j
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Obstacle Avoidance, $F_{oa}$}
The same principle as for collision avoidance can be applied to obstacle avoidance. Now each obstacle needs to be handled as an agent, which will make the same result, but the reference is a little different:
\[
    F_{oa}^{ik}= 
\begin{cases}
    \frac{K_{oa}}{||d_{ki}||}-\frac{K_{oa}}{r},& \text{for } ||d_{ki}||<r\\
    0,              & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]
where $k$ denotes the counter for obstacles instead of other agents. $K_{oa}$ is also a tuning parameter for the obstacle avoidance. $d_{ki}$ is the distance between an agent and the obstacle, which in a total term is summed up as:
\begin{align}
F_{oa}^{tot} = \sum\limits_{k=1}^MF_{oa}^{ik} \text{ for } i\neq k
\end{align}
Here $d_{ki}$ represents one of the $M$ place vectors which has the effect as a detected obstacle.
The distance $r$ can be determined dynamically depending on the velocity of the agent:
\begin{align}
r = r^{min} + K_r||\dot{p^n}||
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Potential field}
Now these forces needs to be summed together to get $\tilde{F}_i^{tot}$ which gives the magnitude and direction of the potential field for vehicle $i$ at its current position. As the potential field does not need to expand to infinity it is reasonable to define a maximum amplitude for the vector, while still keeping its direction:
\begin{align}
F_i^{tot} = min\{\,\,\,||\tilde(F)_i^{tot}||\,\,\,,\,\,F_{max}\,\,\,\}\frac{\tilde{F}_i^{tot}}{||\tilde{F}_i^{tot}||}
\end{align}

\section{The Potential Field Strategy}
The theory of potential fields are implemented with the strategy proposed in section \ref{sc:potential-fields}. The potential field is generated for each individual agent at every update step to make the formation move and converge to a specified formation and position. The field is generated based on forces acting in a overlying potential field structure where one force converges the agent to a desired position, a force attracting the agent to obtain the desired formation along the trajectory, a force repelling the agent from other agents is their distance is too small and finally a force repelling the agents from static objects. The latter two can seem the same, but the repelling force will be larger for the agent-agent force due to the fact that two agents could have course directly toward each other and a more aggressive avoidance can be needed.

To be able to generate and simulate the potential field then implementation needs to be generic. First it was developed with one agent that needs to converge to a desired position and afterwards were other agents added as obstacles and some static objects were added in extend. From these obstacles it can be seen that a single agent are able to converge to a position which makes it possible to expand such that more agents can converge into formation with reference from either a virtual leader or from each other. This will solve the formation coordination task, where the following task will be the group coordination task. The group coordination task has the goal to move the formation around, which here will be done by making the virtual leader, or an actual leader of the formation, follow a trajectory specified. This will make the other agents follow this leader and withhold their formation on the trajectory.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{fig/ftotmagnfigpdf1}
  \caption{Plot of one agent's trajectory with a desired position with obstacles to avoid}
  \label{fig:potfieldagenti}
\end{figure}
A plot for a total potential reference field for a single agent can be seen on figure \ref{fig:potfieldagenti}. The red line made of crosses are the trajectory that one single agent will follow, if the obstacles to avoid in the plot are static. In the plot every object, either an other agent or an object, are kept static. So it shows how the trajectory will be in one single time step. This will change in the next time step if the other agents also move in the potential field. The agent avoids obstacles on the way, where it can be seen that it does not get into the safety radius of the obstacles. In this specific plot is a safety radius ($r$) of $20$m chosen, such that the distance from agent $p_i$ (The red trajectory) to any obstacle always will be larger than $20$m.
This radius applies both to other agents seen in the following equation
\[
    F_{ca}^{ij}= 
\begin{cases}
    \frac{K_{ca}r}{||d_{ij}||}-K_{ca},& \text{for } ||d_{ij}||<r\\
    0,              & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]
and to obstacles seen in the following equation
\[
    F_{oa}^{ik}= 
\begin{cases}
    \frac{K_{oa}}{||d_{ki}||}-\frac{K_{oa}}{r},& \text{for } ||d_{ki}||<r\\
    0,              & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]
where the gains $K_{ca}$ and $K_{oa}$ are chosen equally to a constant as 240. If this gain is chosen smaller it will result in that the agents are more allowed to approach the obstacles and get a little within the radius, but then afterwards getting repelled from the object. It corresponds to the gradient at the radius and how steep this is.

The same algorithm is applied where agent $i$ avoids other agents, agent $j$, $j+1$. This can be seen on figure \ref{fig:avoidagent}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{fig/ftotmagnfigpdf}
  \caption{Agent $i$ avoids agent $j$ and converges to the minima at the virtual leader}
  \label{fig:avoidagent}
\end{figure}
Agent $i$ takes a direct course toward the virtual leader but meets another agent as an obstacle. Agent $i$ moves on the boarder of agent $j$ with the defined safety radius and afterwards diverges from agent $j$ towards the virtual leader. This is all done by following the lowest gradient at all times.

The gain of $K_{ij}$ is not to be interpret from figure \ref{fig:potfieldagenti}. $K_{ij}$ is the gain to the force that attracts the agents together by minimizing the distance in between them. By doing this the agents will get faster into the desired formation. The gain $K_{vl}$ does at some point the opposite. This gain adjusts the weighting of how fixated the agents should be to converge to the desired position. If this gain is relatively larger than $K_{ij}$ then the agents will converge directly to their position around the virtual leader and not converge to the desired formation on the way. This implies that the scaling between $K_{vl}$ and $K_{ij}$ controls if the formation should converge to the desired formation on the way to desired position, or if agent $i$ should only have the desired position in focus.

The grid in which the potential field is generated are limited with a certain resolution while simulating the agents movement. This reduces the directions of where the agents can move, which will not arise a problem on the same level when implemented in reality. In the simulation environment it reduces the resolution such that a single field in the grid contains one value of magnitude of the potential field, which makes the basis of a certain gradient to the field. The agents are following the implementation of the steepest decent. This generates a gradient towards the steepest decent, which the agent tracks. The analogy can be seen as a bowl, or sphere in this case, where a ball will converge towards the lowest point in the direction of the minimum gradient.

The method of applying the grid with magnitude of the potential field arises the problem with resolution, but also a problem that makes the 'corners' of the grid around the agent to be more likely to have the steepest decent. This is seen as if the agent is placed in the middle of a 3-by-3 matrix, and have eight placements around it. This problem has been expanded with a solution such that a certain radius in the potential field around an agent will be checked. The value at the radius around the agent can be checked, and due to the equal distance to every point, these will be weighted equally with respect to their value. This makes in principle the possibility to make the agent go in all directions which will be closer to the reality. When testing the two methods against each other it is clear that the first proposed with the grid structure did not have the same mobility thus not preferable in simulations though it is simpler.

Another problem that can become crucial arises when two agents or two objects are within the radius of each other. This will result in a local minima in the potential field between those objects. This will create a small local minima in between these agents or objects. If an agent converges toward this minima they cannot get out again. The problem can be seen on figure \ref{fig:roevproblem}. The gains here are chosen exactly the same as in figure \ref{fig:potfieldagenti}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{fig/ftotmagnfigpdf3}
  \caption{An agent gets stuck due to a local minima between two other agents. The agent cannot get out of this minima unless the other two agents makes the space for the agent to pass through}
  \label{fig:roevproblem}
\end{figure}
The scenario on figure \ref{fig:roevproblem} has the following steps. The agent $i$ moves in the direction of the steepest decent. Then it gets to the border of another agent where it cannot go through thus starts to go around this agent. The problem arises when agent $i$ reaches another agent on the way where it now has reached a local minima. Now the steepest gradient will point at the position where the agent already is thus making it think it has reached the end point. Solutions to this problem can be formulated in different ways. One solution could be to cluster the two objects together and instead of making their potential field individually, then combine those together and make an ellipsoid or even a circle formed obstacle of those objects. This will ensure that the local minima disappears thus not making an agent get stuck between those objects. Another solution is to make an exception handler that can tell if agent $i$ has reached the desired position. If it has not reached its end point, and the position is placed in a constant spot, it perturbs the desired position of the agent until the direction of the steepest decent changes. This will mean that the agent is out of the local minima and can continue on the trajectory.

In the end this results in that the every agent needs a magnitude and a direction of which they should move. This will be given depending on the total environment where the agents are manoeuvring. When applying this formation strategy a collision free movement are guaranteed which is one of the more critical criteria to be fulfilled. \todo{Det her skal der nok skrives lidt matematik om som viser det, eller en god forklaring. Men dog er det jo en naturlig del af pot field.}

\includesvg{potentialfield_block}
\caption{Block diagram showing the iteration process of using the
potential fields for computation of the input vector}
\label{fig:potentialfield_block}
\end{figure}

The potential field control system consists of multiple elements
as seen with the e flow is illustrated on the block diagram on
figure~\vref{fig:potentialfield_block}.

Part og this flow can be computed by the $i$'th ship themselves.

The implementation of this is tested in matlab, using the m-files;

potfield.m, pathgen.m, shipcontroller.m, simaauship.m

The simulation algorithm for the multiship potential field should keep
in mind that shall save the timeseries for the ship states, the
control inputs and the local reference trajectory for the $i$'th ship.

Ignoring the initialization of all the variables, the outer loop
guidance navigation and control algorithm using potential fields are
as follows.

The \ac{GNC} works by an array of mission specific way points given,
usually computed from a desired area used to create a lawnmower
pattern described in chapter~\vref{ch:pathgen} describing the path
generation.

\paragraph{Global Trajectory Generation}
Then different methods can be used to steer ships after this
trajectory. The simplest is the usual heading autopilot, which will
just steer the reading of the ship to the course angle to the
way point. Or more elaborate, ways is the use of the way points as
linesegments that the ship should follow. This is implemented with a
\ac{LOS} algorithm. This algorithm, can work, but it is too simple to
include obstacle or inter vehicle collisions. A way proposed to solve
this issue is to use the concept of potential fields.

\paragraph{Potential Field}
The potential field itself is merely some functions describing the
repulsive and repelling forces between points of interest in the map.
These points of interest are all objects that matters for the
navigation, that is all ships, the anchor point (virtual leader) of
the formation, and other point obstables. This using the methodology
described in the paper \citep{UAVff3dpf}.

The potential field is used in an iterative algorithm which can
calculate the direction (from the $i$'th boat to the desired position
spaned by a potential field defining the formation.

\paragraph{Local Trajectory Generation}
In the end, a reference path is calculated by the means of the
previous previous position and the result from the potential field
solver. It is calculated as the paper presents, \citep[eq.
48]{UAVff3dpf}.

\begin{align}
	\mathbf{p}_{i,r}^n = \mathbf{p}_i^n + \mathbf{F}_i ^\text{tot}
\end{align}

This is passed to the ships inner control loop.

When the trajectory is generated from a series of way points, which is
not ordered as a series of equidistant way points, it means that some
handling of when or how to update the position of the virtual leader
is needed.

For example; in the case, where the way points are far from each
other, it is still desired to make the virtual leader trajectory
converge the line between these two way points, kind of like the
\ac{LOS} guidance. Earlier a path following algorithm using a \ac{LOS}
principle was used, to calculate a course angle to a point projected
into the line between two way points with a specified lookahead
distance. The projection with the lookahead ensures convergence to the
line. But in the case of controlling the virtual leader, it is not
necessary to calculate the course angle from the virtual leader to the
projected point, because this is only a virtual anchor of the
formation, hence this only specifies where the geometry of the
formation is calculated from. 

For the inner loop, a heading based \ac{LOS} method can still be used,
but this should be calculated for every ship, with each their
reference position $\mathbf{p}_{i,r}$.

	\caption{This pseudo code describes how the potential field is used
	for each boat to calculate the reference for the inner controller
	for every boat at every time step. Every iteration in the while loop
	is a time step.\vspace{6pt}}
	\label{al:potfield}
\end{algorithm}

The algorithm~\vref{al:potfield} describes how the potential field
strategy can be simulated, were each iteration of the while loop is a
time step, which means that the control will continue until the
formation has reached the way point acceptance radius of the track.
This is to ensure that the formation anchor do not move forward if the
ships are not properly in formation. This is analogous with the group
coordination task as defined by \citep{thorvaldsen}, and described in
section~\ref{sc:initialisation}.

For the real implementation in \ac{ROS}'s node structure, only loop
inside the for every boat should be a node, such that there could be
$i$ instances of this node, each representing one boat.
