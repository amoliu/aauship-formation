\section{Model Verification}
\label{sec:model_verification}
In order to confidently use the model developed in the modelling chapter~\vref{ch:modelling}, it is important to verify that it actually reflect the real behaivour of the ship. This section will be used as a sanity check for the model and give indication of how well the model fits with the real ship.

As the hydrodynamic model parameters has been determined the appendix\vref{app:damping}, using the state space representation presented in \vref{eq:ss}.

\subsection{Step Response}
A step response of the model can be used to verify the steady state input output relations.

\subsection{Stability}
A stability analys can be conducted by examing the eigen values of the system, they should all be stable for this system.

Stability of the discretised version also has to be done by ensuring that the pole-zero map is within the unit circle.

\subsection{Simulation of the Model}
A final verification is to compare the correlation between a sea trail operated by human operator. It is desired to do multiple manoeuvers similar to what the system is supposed to perform. That is i.e. making a e.g. turning circle manoeuver and zig-zag manoeuvers.
\todo{Compare the simulation with the same inputs as a sea trail, especially for the inertial sensors}
