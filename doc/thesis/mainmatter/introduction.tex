\head{In this chapter is the motivation for the project stated and the previous work within the subject will be summed up.}

\section{Motivation and the AAUSHIP Project}
The port of Aalborg would like Aalborg University to help them to expand their options of improving the conditions of the Limfjord. One of their tasks is to map the seabed of the Limfjord to get bathymetry data. This will help them guide larger cargo ships to port while using the autonomous ships as guidance.

Another aspect from the port of Aalborg is a task to escort larger ships with cargo into the port of Aalborg. This is done by a pilot whom needs to sail out to incoming larger cargo ships and escort them safely into port. The pilot does this in a pilot boat which is controlled manually by the pilot. The port of Aalborg would like this process to become autonomous such that an autonomous boat can sail to the cargo ship and to some extend take over the control and guide the cargo ship into port. The system to do this implies that the port of Aalborg needs an autonomous ship which can perform this task.

The mapping itself can be done by one ship or by more. For the moment one of the ships from the port of Aalborg, which is manned, and covers the mapping of the closer part of the Limfjord ($\approx$ 65 km). This is only done every third year, but mapping around Hals Barre (a sandbar \todo{slet efterf√∏lgende kommentar igen engang}and not a beach bar) at the end of the Limfjord is a more critical place and is mapped every third month.

If the port of Aalborg had an autonomous ship fleet at their disposal, which could sail out and do the mapping autonoumously, they would get updated bathymetry maps with a higher update frequency than they have currently.  \cite{portofaalborg}.

This thesis will utilise formation control and extensions to manoeuvre agents through a specified area for surveying purposes. Chapter~\vref{ch:formcontrol} will introduce what kind and scopes of formation control that exists today.These theories makes the basis for the formation control within the scope of this project.

\section{The Mission}
Within the scope of this project the robots will be unmanned ships,
\ac{ASV}. The ship's main purpose will be to map the seabed by using
sonars to obtain bathymetry data. When one ship need to do this alone, and due to the range of
the sonar, the time spend could be improved by using multiple ships. The sonar scanning would
be done as seen on figure~\vref{fig:concept-art}.

\end{figure}

When only one ship (figure~\vref{fig:concept-art1}) need to map a complete seabed this process could
take up much time dependent on the area that need to be covered. The
time spend could be improved to make this mapping more efficient. One
way of optimizing the time used is to add more ships (figure~\vref{fig:concept-art3}) to help map the
seabed. To make the process of this as optimal as possible it could be
of benefit to implement formation control in the specific assignment.

I cooperation with the port of Aalborg, a use case is presented, where we can perform tests of the platform, and use those to compare the performance of our system to their system.

\end{figure}

%This could be done in several ways, but is mostly thought of in a
%rigid formation, such that the formation maps the same area of the
%seabed the whole time. The idea can be seen on
%figure~\vref{fig:concept-art}.
