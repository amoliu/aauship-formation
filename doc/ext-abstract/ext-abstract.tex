%Here's a suggestion as to what an extended abstract should contain:
%
%    Background - A little history about who's done what and how your work fits in with it.
%    Aim - What you're trying to tell the audience that they don't already know (e.g. Your story.)
%    Method - Why the audience should believe that the results you've got aren't made up or flawed
%    Results - Evidence that you've come up with that confirms your story
%    Conclusion - Recap of your story and its implications
%    Limitations - Why someone might doubt your story and what you've done to get rid of as much doubt as possible.
%
%What if I'm presenting a review of my progress to date and I have no original research?
%Method = literature survey.
%Results = what you've read.
