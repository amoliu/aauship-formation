This report documents the design and implementation of optimal control
of a helicopter test setup controlling the travel and elevation with
and without feedback using a linear quadratic controller.

The helicopter model has 3 degrees of freedom, controlled by two
horizontal propellers to adjust pitch and elevation, nonzero pitch
makes it travel.

The implementation is done in \MATLAB\ and with QuaRC from Quanser
integrated with Simulink and MathWorks' Real-Time Workshop. The code
and simulink models are also presented in the appendix.
