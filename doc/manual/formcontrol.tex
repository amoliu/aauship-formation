\head{This section will give a short introduction to formation control in general followed by some of the individual assignments which needs to be determined before the process of design can be started.}
The theory of formation control in general is widely applied. It can be applied in assignments regarding control of robots which needs to be placed relative to each other. Depending on the given task of the robots, and which type of robots are in focus, the formation can be utilized in different ways. The robots can also be of various types: Swarm robots, driving vehicles, helicopters, aeroplanes, ships etc. which can both be manned and unmanned. The tasks that these robots need to fulfill can vary a lot and be both as individuals in the formation and as a whole group. Swarm robots in general got many purposes such as vacuum cleaning robots who needs to clean a rather large area or flying robots like quadcoptors who can make different kinds of assignments. When they work as a combined group they could lift a certain amount of payload to achieve their goal as a group, or they could work individually in a network to do several smaller tasks. An example of how quadcoptors are working together can be examined at \citep{ethswarm}.

Within the scope of this project the robots will be unmanned ships, \ac{ASV}. The ship's main purpose will be to map a sea bed by using sonars. When one ship need to do this alone, and due to the range of the sonar, then this time could be improved. The sonar scanning would be done as seen on figure \missingfigure{Billede af enkelt baad som anvender sonar til at scanne havbund}. One way of optimizing the time used is to add more ships to help map the sea bed. To make the process of this as optimal as possible it could be of benefit to implement formation control in the assignment. This could be done in several ways, but is mostly thought of in a rigid formation, such that the formation maps the same area of the sea bed the whole time. The idea can be seen on figure \missingfigure{Billede af flere baade som anvender sonar til at scanne havbunden}. The distances between the ships would be determined by how the sonars would reach the sea bed. There should be some overlap of the maps from each sonar but still as little as possible. The specific formation could be a simple line or it could be more advanced formations. This does not have any impact of how the mappings would be due to the subsequent processing of the collected data from the sea map. Different formations of ships can be seen on figure \ref{fig:diffforms}.
