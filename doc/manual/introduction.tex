\section{Introduction}
This lab report is a answer to the exercises given in \cite{labex},
which states four main exercises as:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Repetition/introduction to use Simulink/QuaRC to control the
helicopter.
\item Optimal control of pitch/travel with no feedback. An optimal
input sequence that moves the helicopter 180 degrees should be
calculated and implemented on the helicopter.
\item Optimal control of pitch/travel with feedback (LQ control).
Feedback is introduced in the controller from part 2.
\item Optimal control of pitch/travel and elevation with and without
feedback; that is, we have an optimal trajectory in two dimensions.
\end{enumerate}
These exercises will be presented in chronological order in the
sections~\ref{sec:prob1}, \ref{sec:prob2}, \ref{sec:prob3} and
\ref{sec:prob4}.
